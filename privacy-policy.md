## How We Use Your Information

We use the collected information to:

## Data Storage

All data collected by EV Charging Tracker is stored locally on your device. We do not:

## iCloud Backup (Optional)

If you enable iCloud backup on your device, your EV Charging Tracker data may be backed up to your personal iCloud account. This backup is:

- Encrypted by Apple
- Accessible only through your iCloud account
- Subject to Apple's Privacy Policy

You can disable iCloud backup for this app in your device settings.

## Location Services

If you grant location permissions, we use your location data to:

You can revoke location permissions at any time through your device settings. The app will continue to function without location services, but you'll need to manually enter location information if desired.

## Data Sharing and Third Parties

We do not sell, trade, or transfer your personal information to third parties. Your data remains on your device and is not accessible to us or any third parties.

## Data Security

We implement appropriate technical measures to protect your data:

- All data is stored locally on your device using iOS secure storage mechanisms
- No data transmission to external servers
- Data is protected by your device's built-in security features

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by:

- Posting the new Privacy Policy in the app
- Updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy

Your continued use of the app after changes are posted constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.

## Data Retention

Data is retained on your device until you manually delete it. We do not have access to your data and therefore do not control retention periods.
