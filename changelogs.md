## 2026.1.3 (2026-01-10)

We have improved prices filling when adding new expense. Now, when you select a charging station, the app will suggest the last used price for that station. This should make adding expenses faster and more convenient, especially if you frequently use the same charging stations.

## 2026.1.2 (2026-01-06)

We added pagination output to Expenses screen so you will not have to scroll for ages if you have lot of records.
In addition, we changed the app version pattern, so you will know in what year and month the app was released.
We are not sure if you need this information, but we did it. Also, the previous 2026.1.1 release contained bug related to version checker, so it was fixed as well
